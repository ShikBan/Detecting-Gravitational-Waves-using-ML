This class project is done as a part of Machine Learning course. 

The main goal of this project is to detect the Gravitational Waves using Neural Networks. 

Data - Taken from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/g2net-gravitational-wave-detection/

Model - Various models tested but CNN works best 

Final thoughts - It was hard to work with enormous amount of data which had noise. But it was also fun to classify a binary black hole collision from the noise.
